This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Firebase where the `getDoc()` method returns `undefined` even when the document exists in the Firestore database. The issue is usually related to asynchronous operations and data handling.  The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version. The solution involves proper error handling and ensuring the data is accessed after the asynchronous operation completes.
